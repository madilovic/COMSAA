Clustal Omega Multiple Sequence Alignment Analysis

The script requires a clustal omega MSA file, together with the file of the same name containing the "start" and the "end" of the coding sequences in a csv file that has the necessary info in the columns "start" and "end". Both of the files should be in the "input" folder next to the script file.
